                        <p>In case you need tissues, Jenny will have some for you. I told you, I would include your
                           dad in every way possible. It starts here. It has always started here. I miss your Dad a lot and I know you miss him even more. 
                           I tried to pray every day, ever since he passed, to help me be the one you needed in your life. After all, he gave me 
                           the blessing I needed. I just took a bit longer than I wanted but I'm glad you waited for me. Now begins our year long journey together
                           till the date. And I know your Dad is up there watching over us, every step of the way.

                           Freaking dorky us, researching how to kiss. We ended up being exposed by my sister and cousins. Smooch smooch smooch! I always
                           wore that nice guy shirt because honestly, I wanted you to know I was a nice guy. I'm glad you've stuck with me this entire time.
